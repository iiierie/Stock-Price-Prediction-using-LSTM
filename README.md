## Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    - is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is commonly used for sequential data analysis and prediction. It is particularly well-suited for tasks such as stock price prediction, where the historical sequence of data plays a crucial role in forecasting future trends.
    - LSTM networks excel at capturing long-term dependencies in data, allowing them to effectively model complex temporal patterns. This makes them a popular choice for time series analysis, including stock market prediction.
    - By leveraging the power of LSTM, researchers and data scientists have developed various approaches to predict stock prices. These approaches involve training LSTM models on historical stock price data and using the learned patterns to make future predictions.
    - The provided links offer examples and tutorials on how to utilize LSTM for stock market analysis and prediction. They provide valuable resources for understanding the implementation of LSTM in this context.
